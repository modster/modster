DataDrivenDashboards automates trade execution, decision making, book keeping, and more. Manage all of your exchange accounts, thier histories, balances, wallets from a powerful desktop application. Have you ever watched helplessly as a trade turned against you because your exchange's laggy web page or mobile app wouldn't load? Our non blocking multithreaded architecture executes trades in milliseconds by connecting directly to the exchange's server via fast and secure websockets. Pros don't use the website to trade, they use the API! It's faster and more secure.

Keep your crypto where it belongs, AT HOME, not in the cloud.
